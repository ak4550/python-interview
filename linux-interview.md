## How does SSH works?
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a protocol used for securely connecting to a remote server or device over a network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, such as the internet, by encrypting the communication between the client and the server. Here's a basic overview of how SSH works:
- Client-Server Connection:
    The process begins with a client initiating a connection to a server. The client is the computer or device from which you want to connect, and the server is the remote computer or device to which you want to connect.
- Initiating the Connection:
  The client sends a request to the server to start a secure connection. This request typically involves negotiating encryption algorithms, authentication methods, and other parameters for the secure communication.
- Key Exchange:
  One of the crucial steps in the SSH process is the key exchange. SSH uses public-key cryptography to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the communication. The client and server exchange public keys during the connection setup.
- User Authentication:
  After the key exchange, the client and server perform user authentication. There are various methods for user authentication in SSH, including password-based authentication, public key authentication, and more. Public key authentication is generally considered more secure.
- Encrypted Communication:
  Once the client and server have authenticated each other, they establish a secure, encrypted communication channel. All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
- Session Establishment:
  Once the secure channel is established, a session is created for the user. The user can then interact with the remote server through a command-line interface or execute other programs securely.
- Data Transfer:
  Any data transferred between the client and server, including commands, file transfers, and responses, is encrypted and transmitted through the secure channel.
- Connection Termination:
  When the user decides to end the SSH session, a termination message is sent, and the secure connection is closed.
SSH can be used for various purposes, such as remote command-line access, file transfer (using tools like SCP or SFTP), and even for tunneling other network protocols securely.
It's important to note that the security of SSH relies on the proper configuration of encryption algorithms, authentication methods, and key management practices. Users are encouraged to keep their SSH software and configurations up to date to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
